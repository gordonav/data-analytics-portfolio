Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio📊📈

My eagerness for precision and diligently working until I produce accurate and insiguful results goes back to my childhood days and my love for solving jigsaw puzzles. Large, chaotic, jumbled, and always short of a few pieces, I was never phased as I thought about the picture waiting on the other end. Today, I have a strong passion for data cleaning, visualizations, and creating effective analyses.
